## Student database query

**Task**: Develop a [``StudentDB``](./StudentDB.java) class that searches the student database.
The [``StudentDB``](./StudentDB.java) class must implement the [``StudentQuery``](./StudentQuery.java) interface (simple version) or [``GroupQuery``](./GroupQuery.java) (complex version).
Each method must consist of exactly one statement. In this case, long statements should be split into several lines.  

When performing the task, you should pay attention to: 

1. The use of lambda expressions and threads;
2. Getting rid of repetitive code.
