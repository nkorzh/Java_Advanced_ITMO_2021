## Immutable set on the array

**Task**: Develop an ``ArraySet`` class that implements an immutable ordered set.  
The ``ArraySet`` class must implement the [``SortedSet``](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/SortedSet.html) (simple version) or
 [``NavigableSet``](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/NavigableSet.html) (complex version) interface.
All operations on sets must be performed with the highest possible asymptotic efficiency.  

When completing the task, you should pay attention to:

1. Use of standard collections.
2. Getting rid of repetitive code.
