This folder contains two tasks:

**Jar Implementor**: 

1. Create it `.jar` file containing the compiled Implementor and associated classes.
2. Created  `.jar` file should be launched with the java `-jar` command.

Implementor with arguments `-jar <class-name> <filename.jar>` should pack the generated implementation to given `<filename.jar>` file.
